## Overview

I chose this challenge as part of my exercises to master the Grid. It went well, I think!

### The challenge

The challenge was to build out this single price grid component challenge and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
For me, working with `justify-content`, `justify-items`, `align-content` and `align-items` for centering grid items was a new challenge. I learned a lot about them.
